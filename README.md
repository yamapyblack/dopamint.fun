## Vision
Change boring NFT minting into a thrilling FOMO game.

## Problem
1. **No instant reveals**  
   You have to wait before you can see your NFT, and that waiting kills the thrill and breaks the hype.  
2. **No clear win or loss**  
   You pay to mint but don‚Äôt know if you got something rare or just a common NFT. Mints feel flat‚Äîno thrill, no FOMO.  
3. **Low liquidity**  
   If you miss out on a rare drop, you can‚Äôt sell or trade right away‚Äîyou‚Äôre stuck waiting for a buyer.

## Solution
‚úÖGacha-style, on-chain minting that fixes all these problems. When you mint, you see the result instantly on the blockchain and can trade right away.
